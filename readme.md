# Automatic Tabs Volume

A Chrome extension to mute unused video tabs.

## Why?

I used like to watch stream and video, but there is one situation that is uncomfortable for me. In this case, when I open multiple live broadcasts or videos, the background sound of multiple tabs is very confusing, and I can't distinguish the primary and secondary.

So, I made this extension to mute the unused video tabs. It can make me focus on the current video or stream.
Maybe this will help you too.

## How to use

You can download this compressed package in your computer, and plug it into your Edge.

Hope you like.
